Choosing courses at the beginning of a semester is a familiar challenge for students at IIIT Hyderabad, with numerous factors to consider. Making an informed decision is crucial, as the wrong choice can adversely affect academic performance. To address this common dilemma, we present 'Review IIITH,' a dedicated community platform designed for our college's students. 'Review IIITH' serves as a valuable repository of course reviews contributed by fellow students who have previously taken those courses. This platform aims to empower students with insights, experiences, and recommendations, helping them make more informed decisions about their academic journey. By fostering a collaborative environment, 'Review IIITH' seeks to ease the course selection process and enhance the overall academic experience for the IIIT Hyderabad community.
